        Richard is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, where he has been on the faculty since 1986, with brief leaves to [Indian Institute of Science](http://www.iisc.ernet.in/), [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com), and PATH. His research has focussed on computing for the developing world since 2005, when he became involved with the Digital Study Hall project. In 2009, Richard spent a sabbatical year working with the [Digital Health Solutions](http://sites.path.org/hmis/) group at PATH, a global health NGO based in Seattle. This opportunity allowed him to increase his efforts on applying computing technologies to challenges in global health. While working with PATH, he co-founded the Projecting Health project, which uses the Community-Led Video Education model to promote healthy practices in rural areas in India. Back at University of Washington, he is now overseeing the efforts of the Open Data Kit project. His research interests in ICTD include technologies for behavior change communication, improving tools to support the use of data in strengthening health systems, and digital financial services.

        Kurtis is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering. He received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley where he worked on Commmunity Cellular Networks: low-cost, low-power, locally owned cellular infrastructure. After Berkeley he co-founded [Endaga](http://endaga.com) to commercialize the work on Community Cellular and joined Facebook to continue that effort. His research focuses primarily on access, continuing to build and evaluate Community Cellular networks the world over, in partnership with organizations such as Rhizomatica, Facebook, and others. He is a developer on [CommunityCellularManager](https://github.com/facebookincubator/CommunityCellularManager) and a close partner with Facebook's [OpenCellular](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1754757044806180/introducing-opencellular-an-open-source-wireless-access-platform). Beyond access he also is interested broadly in cellular. Some examples projects include countering "Stingray" IMSI-catcher devices and lower-power communications.
