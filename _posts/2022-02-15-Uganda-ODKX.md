Waylon Brunette travelled to Kampala Uganda for launch of the ODK-X Cold Chain Information System (CCIS).   This is a joint project between the ICTD Lab,  PATH (a Seattle based NGO),  and the Ugandan ministry of health.  The system allows immunization workers to track the status of the countryâ€™s vaccine cold chain and to provide information to the immunization system to help manage national logistics.  The system was built on the ODK-X mobile data management platform.  Waylon went to Uganda to work on system integration and to participate in the national training for district level immunization managers.
