We won a NSF Smart & Connected Communities grant ($1.3 million over 3 years) for participatory design of community-focused applications on top of the [Seattle Community Network](https://seattlecommunitynetwork.org/)! Our community partners include the Black Brilliance Research Project, the Tacoma Cooperative Network, and the Tacoma Public Libraries.
